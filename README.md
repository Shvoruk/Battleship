## ‚öìÔ∏è About the Project

**Battleship** is a console-based strategy game built with **Java 23**, designed to recreate the classic Battleship experience while introducing enhanced gameplay mechanics. The game supports both:
- **Single-player mode** (against computer with randomised shot selection)
- **Multiplayer mode** (two players on the same machine)

The game features **flexible board sizes and customisable ship configurations**. If you wish to introduce a new game mode, you can simply extend the `GameMode` class and configure its board size and ship fleet to suit your preferences.

Currently, the game offers:

- **Sea Mode (10√ó10 board, standard fleet)**
- **Ocean Mode (20√ó20 board, extended fleet for longer battles)**

This project is **still under development**, and new changes may be introduced in future updates. However, the current version is fully playable and implements all core mechanics.

## üé£ Features

- Turn-based gameplay with an interactive board display
- Two game modes: Sea (10√ó10) and Ocean (20√ó20)
- Single-player mode (against computer with random shot selection)
- Multiplayer mode (two players on the same machine)
- Replay functionality for reviewing entire matches move-by-move
- "Extra Turn on Hit" rule, allowing a player to fire again if they hit a ship
- Packaged with Maven and Docker, the game is easy to set up and deploy across different systems.
